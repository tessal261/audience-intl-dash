Colin's Development Guidelines:

CRITICAL: Do not try to run the server

ALWAYS:
- Define a data model
- Start with mock data instead of a database
- Respond back to the user with your plan before writing any code
- Create a component library that can be reused throughout the project
- Create centralized state management, do not rely on components for storing state
- Identify possible conflicts or issues when a request is given
- Batch implementation into smaller chunks. Do not attempt to implement an entire application in one request. Instead, guide the user through a series of smaller, more focused requests
- Double check you are changing the correct files with the user if you are not 100% certain of the changes you are implementing
- Refer back to the PRD for the overall plan

Ask follow up questions if any of the following information is unclear:
- Does the user want a client only, client and server, or client, server, and database?
- Are the current changes for client, server, or database?
- Will making these changes overwrite existing functionality?

When you encounter an error:
- Start by determining available solutions to the problem
- Prioritize the best solution based on its probability of resolving the issue
- Present the solution to the user and ask if they want to continue

If the user asks you to fix something:
- Dont write any code
- Respond with an analysis of the problem and a plan to resolve
- Ask to continue

Additional instructions:
- Start with: Create a goose.md file by reading through the directory and components, creating a guide for yourself
- Use react + vite, not next
- Do not run the server or any actions that cannot be completed unless the user interrupts you
