# Goose Development Guide - Square Business Application

## Project Overview
This project has evolved from a component library showcase into a comprehensive business application built with React + Vite + TypeScript. It features a sophisticated dashboard, items management system, and a complete UI component library. The application follows clean architecture principles with proper routing, centralized state management, and modular component design.

## Current Architecture

### Technology Stack
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **State Management**: React Context API (Multiple contexts)
- **Routing**: React Router DOM v7.7.0
- **Utilities**: clsx, tailwind-merge

## Current State Analysis

### What's Working ✅
1. **✅ Routing Implemented**: React Router DOM v7 with proper routing structure
2. **✅ Data Models Defined**: Complete TypeScript interfaces for all entities
3. **✅ Mock Data**: Comprehensive mock data across multiple contexts
4. **✅ Component Library**: 25+ UI components including complex ones (Modal, ItemsTable, ProductForm)
5. **✅ Multiple Contexts**: Separate contexts for Dashboard, Items, and Library management
6. **✅ Layout System**: AppLayout with LeftNav for consistent navigation
7. **✅ Business Logic**: Complete CRUD operations for items management
8. **✅ Form Handling**: Complex ProductForm with validation and state management

### Current Application Structure
- **Dashboard Page** (`/`): Business metrics and performance dashboard
- **Items Page** (`/items`): Full inventory management system with CRUD operations
- **Component Library**: Available but not currently routed (MainPage exists but not connected)

### Architecture Strengths
1. **Proper State Management**: Three specialized contexts managing different concerns
2. **Reusable Components**: Well-structured component hierarchy with props interfaces  
3. **TypeScript Coverage**: Comprehensive typing throughout the application
4. **Business Functionality**: Real-world CRUD operations with mock data persistence
5. **Modal System**: Implemented for edit/create workflows

### Remaining Opportunities ⚠️
1. **Component Library Integration**: MainPage exists but not connected to routing
2. **Enhanced Navigation**: Could add more routes like component details pages  
3. **Search Functionality**: SearchTerm state exists in LibraryContext but no UI implementation
4. **Code Examples**: Component interfaces support code examples but not populated
5. **Documentation Pages**: Could expand component documentation and examples

## Development Guidelines Compliance

### ✅ Fully Following Guidelines
- **✅ Data Model**: Well-defined TypeScript interfaces across all domains
- **✅ Mock Data**: Using mock data instead of database connections
- **✅ Component Library**: 25+ comprehensive reusable components
- **✅ Centralized State**: Multiple React Contexts for different concerns
- **✅ React + Vite**: Correct tech stack implementation
- **✅ Batched Implementation**: Evidence of incremental development
- **✅ No Database Dependencies**: Pure frontend with mock data

### 📈 Recently Improved Areas
- **✅ Routing**: React Router DOM properly implemented
- **✅ Business Logic**: Full CRUD operations working
- **✅ Complex Forms**: ProductForm with comprehensive validation
- **✅ Modal System**: Working edit/create workflows

## Recommended Next Steps

### Phase 1: Connect Component Library (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
1. **Add Component Library Route**
   - Add `/components` route to App.tsx
   - Connect MainPage to routing structure
   - Update LeftNav to include component library navigation

2. **Integrate LibraryContext**
   - Add LibraryProvider to App.tsx context stack
   - Ensure search functionality works when route is added

### Phase 2: Enhanced Features (LOW PRIORITY)  
1. **Implement Search UI**
   - Add search input to component library
   - Connect to existing LibraryContext search state

2. **Add Code Examples**
   - Create syntax-highlighted code snippet component
   - Populate codeExample fields in component mock data
   - Display code examples in component cards

### Phase 3: Documentation Enhancement
1. **Component Detail Pages**
   - Individual routes for each component (`/components/:componentId`)
   - Props documentation and usage examples
   - Multiple variants and states

## Current Application Flow

### Primary User Journey
1. **Landing**: Dashboard page with business metrics
2. **Items Management**: Full inventory CRUD with modal-based forms
3. **Navigation**: Sidebar navigation between main sections

### Component Architecture
- **AppLayout**: Main layout wrapper with routing outlet
- **LeftNav**: Consistent sidebar navigation across all pages  
- **Context Providers**: Layered context structure for different data domains
- **Page Components**: Feature-specific pages with focused responsibilities

## Key Components Overview

### New/Enhanced Components
- **Modal**: Reusable modal component for overlays
- **ItemsTable**: Complex data table with actions
- **ProductForm**: Multi-step form with validation

- **Navigation**: LeftNav, DropdownMenu  
- **Complex**: PerformanceDashboard, ProductForm, ItemsTable, Modal

### Context Architecture
- **DashboardContext**: Business dashboard state and metrics
- **ItemsContext**: Complete inventory management with CRUD operations  
- **LibraryContext**: Component library browsing and search (available but not routed)

## Development Best Practices Applied
- **TypeScript**: Comprehensive type safety across all components and contexts
- **Tailwind CSS**: Consistent styling with utility classes
- **Component Composition**: Well-structured reusable component patterns
- **Props Interfaces**: All components have proper TypeScript interfaces
- **Centralized State**: Multiple context providers for different domains
- **Mock Data**: Complete business logic without database dependencies
- **Clean Architecture**: Proper separation of concerns and file organization

- **Routing**: Clean URL structure and navigation

### 🚧 Available But Not Connected
- **Component Library**: MainPage exists with comprehensive component showcase
- **Search Functionality**: LibraryContext has search state management
- **Demo Components**: Multiple working component demonstrations

### 🎯 Next Logical Extensions
1. **Connect Component Library**: Add routing to showcase existing components
2. **Enhanced Documentation**: Code examples and component details
3. **Advanced Features**: Search, filtering, and component details pages

## Architecture Decision Status

### ✅ Resolved Architecture Questions
1. **Primary App Purpose**: Business application (dashboard + inventory)
2. **Routing Strategy**: React Router with nested routes  
3. **State Management**: Multiple contexts for different concerns
4. **Component Strategy**: Comprehensive reusable component library

### 📋 Development Readiness
The application is well-structured for continued development with:
- Clear separation of concerns
- Proper TypeScript coverage
- Established patterns for new features
- Mock data supporting rapid iteration
- Component library ready for integration

This guide reflects the current state as of the latest analysis and should be updated as new features are added or architecture evolves.
